## Matrix is one og the easiest topic. But implementation is important.
## Assignment will be based on this class.

## Java mein pass by reference. In c++ pass by value but with & its pass by reference.
## For python


# P1 How to print a matrix in snake pattern
# 1 2 3
# 4 5 6
# 7 8 9

# 123654789

# Try to write code in a function.

# Solved the question in file P1.py

## P2 Matrix boundary traversal problem. Example:
## 1 2 3 4
## 5 6 7 8
## 9 10 11 12
## 13 14 15 16
## Output 
# 1 2 3 4 
# 5     8 
# 9     12 
# 13 14 15 16 

## P3 Find the transpose of a matrix
##      By defination rows and columns are interchanged.
## 1 2 3
## 4 5 6
## 7 8 9 
## Both ways are allowed, you can create a new matrix or do it in place.
